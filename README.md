# Prisma-SDWAN
Scripts written for Prisma SD-WAN


The main script was built to pull the current state of a tenant so that it can be referenced.

The use case is that for a Prisma SD-WAN eval, it will not be ported to a production environment, so having a capture of the configuration used in the eval will be useful when building out the production environment.
