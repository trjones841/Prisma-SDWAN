# Prisma-SDWAN
Scripts written for Prisma SD-WAN

The main script was built to pull the current state of a tenant so that it can be referenced.

The use case is that for a Prisma SD-WAN eval, it will not be ported to a production environment, so having a capture of the configuration used in the eval might be useful when building out the production environment. 

To get started, just clone this repo to your IDE, then create a cgxauth.py fail based on the cgxauth_example.txt file. 

Report any issues to me and I'll fix, or update and send me pull requests.
